You open a door and you find 3 monsters standing right in front of you.

You must take on one monster to prove your authority over them.
You can 
-> Press 1 to tackle Godzilla
-> Press 2 to tackle King Ghidorah
-> Press 3 to tackle King Kong

Unlike the movies just defeating one of them will show your courage to others and they will back out.

What is your choice Hero?
